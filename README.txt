2D Camera for Cocos2d Objective-C (in Swift)
=====================================================

I created this 2D Camera to be used CocosBuilder and
Cocos2D Objective-C/Swift. In a nutshell, the camera
follows the player at center unless the player reaches
the edge of the level, then the player can freely move
around the screen.

Where to download CocosBuilder? Follow these instructions:

git clone https://github.com/oxeron/cocosbuilder
cd CocosBuilder
git submodule update --init --recursive

Open up the Xcode project file in ./cocosbuilder/CocosBuilder
Do not change any recommended settings, just click “Build” and move the
app into your applications folder.

Enjoy!
