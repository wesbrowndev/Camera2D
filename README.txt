2D Camera for Cocos2d Objective-C (in Swift)
=====================================================

I created this 2D Camera to be used with Cocos2d-ObjC
and SpriteBuilder. This is a SpriteBuilder project!
In a nutshell, the camera follows the player at center
unless they are at the edge of the level, then the
player can freely move around the screen.
